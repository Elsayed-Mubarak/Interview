1- Upcasting and down casting : upcasting is kind of polymerphism and down casting may cause compile error and run time error.

2- Ways to make an object eligible for garbage collection:
	1- Object created inside a method When a method is called it goes inside the stack frame.
	 When the method is popped from the stack, all its members dies and if some objects were 
	created inside it then these objects becomes unreachable or anonymous after method execution 
	and thus becomes eligible for garbage collection.
	2- Reassigning the reference variable: When reference id of one object is referenced to reference 
	id of some other object then the previous object has no any longer reference to it and becomes 
	unreachable and thus becomes eligible for garbage
	3- Nullifying the reference variable : When all the reference variables of an object are changed to NULL,
	 it becomes unreachable and thus becomes eligible for garbage.
	4-Anonymous object : The reference id of an anonymous object is not stored anywhere.
	 Hence, it becomes unreachable.
